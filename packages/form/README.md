To simplify working with forms, we use the library [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) (hereinafter RHF)    
To validate fields we use [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)

### Form component
**Form** - is a wrapper for [RHF's](https://react-hook-form.com/) [`FormProvider`](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/formprovider), to which we pass all props, received from [`useForm`](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/useform) hook.   

There are several special components for use inside the form:
- FieldWrapper
- Field
- TypedField
- FieldArray
- Reset
