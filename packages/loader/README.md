This is a preloader that indicates that the loading is in progress.
So far it has only a `basic` theme

If you need to show the preloader while the data is being loaded, instead of using the `Loader` directly, use the `LoadWrapper`, which was created specifically for processing this case and uses the `Loader` from the inside.
