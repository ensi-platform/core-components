# Popover component

The Popover component is a versatile UI element that displays content relative to an anchor element. It leverages the power of [popper.js](popper.js.org).js for positioning and [react-transition-state](https://github.com/szhsin/react-transition-state) for smooth transitions.

This component is designed to show additional information or interactive elements like tooltips or menus in a floating layer near the anchor element. It can be customized for various display options such as position, transitions, and size.
