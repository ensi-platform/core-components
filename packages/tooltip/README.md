# Tooltip Component

The Tooltip component provides brief, helpful information when users interact with a target element. It can be triggered by hover or click, and disappears when the user moves away. Tooltips are customizable in position, appearance, and behavior, making them ideal for offering quick, non-intrusive guidance or context within your application.

This component is based on the [alfalab/core-components](https://github.com/alfa-laboratory/core-components) library.
