This is a preloader in the form of a skeleton that indicates that the download is in progress.
So far, it has only a `basic` theme.

Without using the `height` prop, the skeleton will adjust to the current `font-size`

This component is based on [react-loading-skeleton](https://github.com/dvtng/react-loading-skeleton#readme)
